# GeoDataSets: Synthetic Subsurface Data Repository (1.0.0) 

## Prof. Michael J. Pyrcz, Associate Professor, The University of Texas at Austin

A collection of synthetic subsurface datasets to support education, publications, and prototyping.

This repository includes a wide variety of synthetic, subsurface datasets with a variety of:

#### Data Dimensionality

To support education with easy visualization and interactivity the datasets are 1D and 2D.

* 1D cores from wells and 2D seismic maps. 

#### Number of Features

For multivariate analysis some of the datasets include up to 6 features with a variety of structures.

* linear and nonlinear, homoscedastic and heteroscedastic, and multivariate constraints 

#### Data Issues

The datasets attempt to include typical issues such as non-physical values, random and structured noise

#### Use and Attribution

You are welcome to use these datasets for any purpose. Please cite as:
